Q) when do you use stacks or queses?
-> when you want to store answer so far and put some results behind you to use those later on
-> group of elements inside data structure,
-> binary tree traversal
-> tees bfs, dfs
-> recursion to iteration programs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q) what is dequeue?
-> insert and delete both from front and back
-----------------------------------------------------------------
-> quee and dequeue are interfaces
------------------------------------------------------------------
Q) arrayDeque
-> no capapcity restrictions
-> faster than LL, stacks
--> cannot store null elements
